The Goal

The primary objective is to develop a small, initial colony into a massive, thriving metropolis. You achieve this by progressing through Development Phases (DP1, DP2, DP3), which are unlocked by upgrading your Administrative Spire. The ultimate end-game goal is to construct powerful Legacy Structures (like the "Genesis Monument" or "Unity Beacon") and research "Apex Technologies".
Core Gameplay Loop

The game is a continuous balancing act between expansion, resource management, and keeping your population happy and productive.
Phase 1: Laying the Foundation (The First Hour)

    Establish Core Infrastructure: You start with a handful of inhabitants and a small number of credits. The very first steps are to build foundational "Operations Hub" structures:
        Power: Build PowerRelays to generate power. Almost everything requires power, and you'll see warnings if you have insufficient generation.
        Resources: Build Extractors to gather raw materials like FerrocreteOre.
        Food: Build Bio-Domes to produce NutrientPaste (food) for your inhabitants. A food deficit will quickly lower happiness.

    Manage Population & Workforce:
        Your starting inhabitants are a finite workforce. To get more workers, you need more people.
        Population grows automatically as long as you have sufficient housing and high Colony Happiness.
        Build Habitation structures (e.g., "Basic Dwellings") to increase your housing capacity and allow the population to grow.
        A basic workforce_assignment_system automatically assigns your available inhabitants to work in the buildings that require them, like Extractors and Bio-Domes.

Phase 2: Becoming a City Manager

    Advance and Unlock: The key to progression is the Administrative Spire. Building and upgrading it unlocks higher Development Phases, which grants access to more advanced buildings, zones, and technologies.

    Meet Citizen Needs (Happiness is Key):
        As your population grows, new needs will arise. The "Colony Status" app will show you diagnostics for things like Healthcare, Security, and Recreation.
        To satisfy these needs and keep happiness high, you must build various Service Buildings (e.g., "Wellness Posts"). High happiness is crucial for continued population growth.

    Specialize Your Workforce (Zones & Advanced Buildings):
        To build a real economy, you need to construct Zones, such as Commercial (to generate credit income) and LightIndustry.
        These zones, along with other advanced buildings, require Specialists. You assign specialists to work in these zones through the "Managed Zones" panel on the Dashboard. This creates a new strategic layer of managing your general inhabitant pool versus your specialized workforce.

    Manage the Economy (Credits):
        Almost all construction and research costs Credits.
        You earn credits primarily from CommercialZone income and bonuses from LegacyStructures.
        Most active buildings have an upkeep cost in credits. If you can't pay the upkeep, buildings will automatically deactivate.

How I Would Interact with the UI

I would primarily use the Command Interface's apps on the left-hand side:

    Dashboard: To get a quick overview. I'd check my notifications for events, monitor the analytics graph to see trends in my population and economy, and use the panels to manage my Administrative Spire and Legacy Structures.
    Construction: This would be my main hub for expansion. I'd flip between the "Operations," "Habitation," "Services," and "Zones" tabs to build what I need next, keeping an eye on the costs and requirements displayed in the details panel.
    Colony Status: I'd check this screen anytime my happiness starts to drop to diagnose what my colony is missing.
    Research: To unlock new capabilities and more powerful buildings.
