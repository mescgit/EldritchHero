feat: Add 20 new auto-attack spells (character archetypes)

Adds 20 new `AutomaticWeaponDefinition` entries to the `AutomaticWeaponLibrary`
in `src/items.rs`. Each definition represents a new auto-attack spell,
effectively creating a new character archetype selectable from your main menu.

The new spells include a variety of fantasy themes such as:
- Inferno Bolt
- Chain Lightning
- Arcane Ray
- Shadow Orb
- Holy Lance
- Venom Spit
- Glacial Spike
- EarthShatter Shard
- Sunfire Burst
- Moonbeam Dart
- Spirit Bomb
- Void Tendril
- Crystal Shard
- Magma Ball
- Sand Blast
- Metal Shrapnel
- Nature's Wrath
- Chi Bolt
- Psionic Lash
- Aether Bolt

Each spell has unique stats (damage, fire rate, speed, piercing,
projectile count, lifetime) and placeholder sprite paths.

Verification of these additions in-game was blocked by a Rust
compiler version mismatch in the execution environment (Bevy 0.13.2
requires Rust 1.76+, environment has 1.75.0). The changes are
structurally sound and should integrate correctly when compiled
with the appropriate Rust version.
