feat: Add 20 new auto-attack spells (character archetypes)

Adds 20 new `AutomaticWeaponDefinition` entries to the `AutomaticWeaponLibrary`
in `src/items.rs`. Each definition represents a new auto-attack spell,
effectively creating a new character archetype selectable from your main menu.

The new spells include a variety of fantasy themes such as:
- Inferno Bolt
- Chain Lightning
- Arcane Ray
- Shadow Orb
- Holy Lance
- Venom Spit
- Glacial Spike
- EarthShatter Shard
- Sunfire Burst
- Moonbeam Dart
- Spirit Bomb
- Void Tendril
- Crystal Shard
- Magma Ball
- Sand Blast
- Metal Shrapnel
- Nature's Wrath
- Chi Bolt
- Psionic Lash
- Aether Bolt

Each spell has unique stats (damage, fire rate, speed, piercing,
projectile count, lifetime) and placeholder sprite paths.

Verification of these additions in-game was blocked by a Rust
compiler version mismatch in the execution environment (Bevy 0.13.2
requires Rust 1.76+, environment has 1.75.0). The changes are
structurally sound and should integrate correctly when compiled
with the appropriate Rust version.






feat: Implement 50 new upgrades with rarity & UI enhancements

This commit introduces a comprehensive upgrade system overhaul:

1.  **Upgrade Rarity**:
    *   Introduced `UpgradeRarity` enum (Regular, Rare, Legendary).
    *   `UpgradeCard` now includes a `rarity` field.
    *   UI for level-up screen now displays borders based on rarity:
        *   Regular: Light Gray
        *   Rare: Purple
        *   Legendary: Gold

2.  **50 New Upgrade Types**:
    *   Added 50 distinct upgrade types to `UpgradeType` enum, focusing on auto-attack modifications and synergies.
    *   These include enhancements to damage (elemental, crit), projectile behavior (piercing, speed, homing, AoE), fire rate, and various utility effects.

3.  **Tiered Effects**:
    *   Each of the 50 upgrade types has Regular, Rare, and Legendary versions, resulting in 150 total upgrade card variations.
    *   Effects scale with rarity (e.g., 10%/20%/30% or 1x/2x/3x magnitudes).

4.  **Survivor Struct Extended**:
    *   Added new fields to `src/survivor.rs` to support the statistical effects of the new upgrades.

5.  **Logic Implementation**:
    *   `apply_chosen_upgrade` in `src/game.rs` now handles all 50 upgrade types and their rarity scaling.
    *   `UpgradePool` in `src/upgrades.rs` is populated with all 150 upgrade cards, with names and descriptions reflecting their specific effects and rarities.
    *   TO-DO comments mark areas in `apply_chosen_upgrade` where more complex systems (e.g., DoT application, advanced projectile mechanics) are needed for certain upgrades.

Verification of these additions in-game was blocked by a Rust
compiler version mismatch in the execution environment. The changes are
structurally sound.
